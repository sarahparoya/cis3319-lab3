# CIS 3319 Lab 3

## Languages and Libraries
- I used Python as my language.
- I utilized the socket, DES, and HMAC, and hashlib libraries.
## IDE
- I used PyCharm as my chosen IDE to code, debug, and run my code. 
## How to Run [See Video]
- To run, you need to have PyCharm, or at least that's how I
chose to run my application.
- Just import the code, then run the server file first, then 
run the client file.
  - In PyCharm, it has its own terminal usage, so it should automatically
    start and connect.
  - You start messaging on the client side first, then switch to the server
    side. It should have received the client message, cipher text, and HMAC, 
    calculated HMAC, and verifed the HMAC. 
  - It keeps going back and forth like that until you type "bye" to exit and 
    terminate the connection.
